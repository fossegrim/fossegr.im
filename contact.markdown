The best way to contact me is to hop on my Discord server [fossegrim's club](https://discord.gg/Dzykafx) and send me a message there. I also enjoy voice chatting if you are up for a chat. The server consists primarily of technology guys, but everyone is welcome!

For personal inquiries, or if you do not use Discord, I am likely to respond on any of the following communication mediums.
- Discord: fossegrim#4268
- Matrix: [@fossgrim:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@fossgrim:matrix.org)
- Email: [fosseolav@gmail.com](mailto:fosseolav@gmail.com)
- Freenode: fossegrim, fossegrim[m] or fossegrim[e]
- Carrier pigeons
- Twitter: [fossegrim](https://twitter.com/olebullsplass)

Feel free to ask me about anything you would like, but I expect a reasonable standard of questions. Please do put *some* effort into answering your questions before contacting me.
