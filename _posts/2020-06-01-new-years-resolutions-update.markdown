* TL:DR

I think I did pretty well this month.

* ~~Finish The Odin Project~~
* Finish [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

I have been focussing on Haskell and competitive programming/cpp/dsa this month too. I aim to finish the last chapter of my Haskell book during the next few days and thereafter do Haskell and competitive programming in the weekends and evenings and focuses primarily on Full Stack Open.

* \[FINISHED\] Perform [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/olebullsplass)

Not much to say. Finished and I'm still doing the second round. I will probably not do a third I don't like using twitter anymore.

* \[FINISHED\] Pass 1000 rating on blitz on [chess.com](https://chess.com/)

* \[FINISHED\] Learn to play an arbitrary song on the bass guitar

I'm still on the bass book although I haven't practiced in a while.

* Read a minimum of four books by the end of the year

I have not finished a book this month, but I have been reading a lot in [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and some in Basic Mathematics. I'm confident in finishing LYAHFYG in May and Basic Mathematics by the end of the year.

I didn't finish [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) as planned last month although I am on the last chapter. I should be able to finish it in the next couple of months. I have also been reading a lot in the [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://github.com/pllk/cphb/raw/master/book.pdf). So far I am 123/279 pages in.

I am confident in reaching my goal here too.

Take care

Olav
