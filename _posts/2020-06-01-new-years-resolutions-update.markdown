* TL:DR

I think I did pretty well this month.

* ~~Finish The Odin Project~~
* Finish [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

I have been focussing on Haskell and competitive programming/cpp/dsa this month too. I aim to finish the last chapter of my Haskell book during the next few days and thereafter do Haskell and competitive programming in the weekends and evenings and focuses primarily on Full Stack Open.

* \[FINISHED\] Perform [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/olebullsplass)

Not much to say. Finished and I'm still doing the second round. I will probably not do a third I don't like using twitter anymore.

* \[FINISHED\] Pass 1000 rating on blitz on [chess.com](https://chess.com/)

I had planned to reach 1000 this month, but that didn't happen. I was feeling unmotivated to play which my games reflected. Regardless I managed to beat my personal best [chess.com](https://chess.com/) rating by 3 points. It's not the progress I had hoped for, but it is progress any way.

To fight my stagnation I will try finding a mentor who will help me for free through Discord or something like that. If you know anyone who will do it feel free to pm me.

I got a mentor of sorts from posting a request on a chess subreddit and I passed 1000 on the 20th May. Thereafter I have been playing on lichess so as to not tank my rating. In the future I want to play more OTB(Over The Board) as it opens up again.

* \[FINISHED\] Learn to play an arbitrary song on the bass guitar

I'm still on the bass book although I haven't practiced in a while.

* Read a minimum of four books by the end of the year

I have not finished a book this month, but I have been reading a lot in [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and some in Basic Mathematics. I'm confident in finishing LYAHFYG in May and Basic Mathematics by the end of the year.

I didn't finish [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) as planned last month although I am on the last chapter. I should be able to finish it in the next couple of months. I have also been reading a lot in the [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://github.com/pllk/cphb/raw/master/book.pdf). So far I am 123/279 pages in.

I am confident in reaching my goal here too.

Take care

Olav
