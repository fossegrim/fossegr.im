title: New Year's Resolutions Update
---

* TL:DR

I'm not all that satisfied with my progress this month. Due to corona and having to stay home my routines have fell somewhat apart.

* ~~Finish The Odin Project~~

As I talked about in the Mars update I wanted to switch to another learning resource. Therefore I replaced this resolution with the following.

* Finish [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

I have finished part 0 and 1 out of 9 parts. So far I like this more than The Odin Project.

* Perform [#100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/olebullsplass)

Today is day 91. Whilst my streak hasn't ended the last days or weeks have been less productive than previously. I used to have a very good study routine where I coded at my school and at the library now I have to code at home which is much harder to me.

* Pass 1000 rating on blitz on [chess.com](https://chess.com/)

Today my rating is 944, I peaked the 16th of Mars at 969. This month is the month where I reach 1000.

Now that I'm writing it down I believe it is time to start scheduling my chess practice better. So far my practice have just been semi-structured. I have been playing gamed and viewing online lessons every day, but how many and for how long has varied. I shall look into how to structure a good chess practice plan and hopefully my progress will accelerate.

To reach 1000 in April I will reimplement my routine of minimum 3 games per day and also analyze all of them. In addition to this I will continue solving puzzles and start reviewing previous [chess.com](https://chess.com) lessons which I have forgot.

* \[FINISHED\] Learn to play an arbitrary song on the bass guitar

I can play Money pretty well now(by my standards). I will start practicing scales on bass as suggested by my brother. I also want to learn Paranoid by Black Sabbath some time, but at the moment my fingers can't keep up with it.

* Read a minimum of four books by the end of the year

I have not read a book this month, but I have bought a math book called Basic Mathematics. The book covers everything you need to know before studying more advanced topics such as Calculus. So far I'm on page 120 out of 426.

Take care

Olav
