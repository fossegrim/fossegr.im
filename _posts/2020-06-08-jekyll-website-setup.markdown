Today I set up my website in Jekyll. It was kind of painful to get working, but now that it's all set up being able to write website content in markdown and have Jekyll take care of all the boring stuff is pretty comfy.

My website as of now

Right now my Jekyll set up is pretty vanilla. I used the default Minima theme and only modified some colors. Eventually I want to capture the feel of my old website, but I ought to make some posts before putting too much effort into that.
