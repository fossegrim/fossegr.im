* TL:DR

Progress this month is miles better than April although not quite to the level of pre-quarantine months.

* ~~Finish The Odin Project~~
* Finish [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

This month I have been focussing on learning Haskell instead of doing the course. I will continue with the course when I finish my Haskell book.

* \[FINISHED\] Perform [#100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/olebullsplass)

I finished this the 10th April and took a couple of days off afterwards. I'm doing another round, but I won't be writing about it here.

* Pass 1000 rating on blitz on [chess.com](https://chess.com/)

I had planned to reach 1000 this month, but that didn't happen. I was feeling unmotivated to play which my games reflected. Regardless I managed to beat my personal best [chess.com](https://chess.com) rating by 3 points. It's not the progress I had hoped for, but it is progress any way.

To fight my stagnation I will try finding a mentor who will help me for free through Discord or something like that. If you know anyone who will do it feel free to pm me.

* \[FINISHED\] Learn to play an arbitrary song on the bass guitar

I bought a book which I'm going through at the moment.

* Read a minimum of four books by the end of the year

I have not finished a book this month, but I have been reading a lot in [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and some in Basic Mathematics. I'm confident in finishing LYAHFYG in May and Basic Mathematics by the end of the year.

Take care

Olav
