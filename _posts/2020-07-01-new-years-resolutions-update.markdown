* ~~Finish The Odin Project~~
* Finish [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

I've finished the Haskell book and worked on FSO.

* \[FINISHED\] Perform [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/olebullsplass)
* \[FINISHED\] Pass 1000 rating on blitz on [chess.com](https://chess.com/)
* \[FINISHED\] Learn to play an arbitrary song on the bass guitar
* Read a minimum of four books by the end of the year

I finished [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and half of [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://github.com/pllk/cphb/raw/master/book.pdf). This means I only have one book left to read.
