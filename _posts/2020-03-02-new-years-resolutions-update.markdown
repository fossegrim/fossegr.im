title: New Year's Resolutions Update
---

I was initially planning to post this yesterday the 1. Mars, but I did not have the time that day. Anyhow here is my progress thus far.

* TL:DR

All is good. I am considering to switch from The Odin Project to another method of learning. Although I am improving my chess rating, I believe I could improve faster.

* Finish [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

At the moment I'm at the very end of 4th section. I will finish this section, but thereafter I might move on to learning more independently. By learning more independently I mean finding my own resources and choosing my own projects. I have a specific project in mind and I think it becomes redundant reinforce the knowledge both with my own projects and with Odin at the same time. If I choose to leave Odin I will begin with focussing on learning front end web development framework. Right now I'm leaning towards React.

* Perform [#100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/olebullsplass)

Again. Not a lot to say here. I program and tweet every day. Today is day 61.

* Pass 1000 rating on blitz on [chess.com](https://chess.com/)

Today my rating is 928, I peaked the 24th of February at 946. Comparing this to my peak rating in January which was 906 the results are not all that impressive. I have made some progress, but the progress made this month is not very impressive. Well, well. Progress is progress.

Now that I'm writing it down I believe it is time to start scheduling my chess practice better. So far my practice have just been semi-structured. I have been playing gamed and viewing online lessons every day, but how many and for how long has varied. I shall look into how to structure a good chess practice plan and hopefully my progress will accelerate.

* Learn to play an arbitrary song on the bass guitar

I can play Money by Pink Floyd in its entirety, so technically I have achieved this goal already. Regardless I won't mark this as finished quite yet. It sounds good to me when I am playing it, but when I listen to recordings I spot a lot of mistake. I posted my playing asking for feedback to a bass forum and I have received many good responses. That I have implemented in my playing. I will mark this as finished when I can play the song perfectly. I might also record a cover.

* Read a minimum of four books by the end of the year

This month was a good day for reading. Flatland arrived and I read through it rapidly. It is a rather short and concise which book suited me perfectly. I also read a technical book about website testing.

This means I have read two out of four books this year and I am only missing two.

Take Care
