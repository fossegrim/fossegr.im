title: New Year's Resolutions Update
---

It's 1. February, and the first month of the year has passed. Now is a great time to evaluate my progress.

* TL:DR

All is going well, but I'm taking a break from reading.

Here are all my resolutions and the progress I have made from 1. Jan to today 1. Feb.

* Finish [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

This is my first and main resolution. To describe where I was the 1. Jan I will share a quote from my log

       - State "DONE"       from "WAIT"       [2020-01-01 Wed 21:08]
         Log: Worked on blogger project. The db migrations and model stuff kind of clicked and I better understood erb loops. Good session
    
    understood erb loops. Good session

This is not very descriptive for anyone other than me. To put things into perspective the entire course is estimated to take a 1000 hours. The 1. Jan I was at the end of webdev 101, ie the first sub course and now I'm in the middle of the 4th one. This is still not very descriptive, but I'm happy with my progress here.

* Perform #100daysofcode

There is not much to say here. I have posted [tweets](https://twitter.com/olebullsplass) (and programmed / studied for one hour++) every day.

* Pass 1000 rating on blitz on [chess.com](https://chess.com/)

The 1. Jan my rating was 851. The 24. Jan I peaked at 906 and since then I have temporarily switched to  playing chess on another site (lichess). I have also joined a real life chess club + course.

* Learn to play an arbitrary song on the bass guitar

I marked this as hard because for a long while completely stopped playing and lacked the motivation to start practicing again. Since 1. Jan I have practiced most days. According to my log I have practiced 26 days since 1. Jan. Not every day, but I'm happy with it anyhow.

In my resolution I specified arbitrary song. I can play feel good inc in its entirety. That song is however very easy to play and not really a *real* song so to speak. Therefore I do not consider this resolution accomplished as of yet. Atm I'm practicing Money by Pink Floyd. To narrow this goal down the "arbitrary song" in my resolution is now Money. I want to be able to play it in its entirety. This is achievable within a couple of weeks I would say.

* Read a minimum of four books by the end of the year

This resolution is really the only resolution where I'm slacking. I was reading What every body is saying at the start of the year. I have read most of it, but I recently got really bored of it and I removed reading from my daily recurring todo list. I will finish the book later, but for now I'm taking a pause. I ordered Flatland and I will start reading daily again when it arrives.

Take care

Olav
