I am Olav. You might also know me as olavx200 or fossegrim which is my pseudonym online. I enjoy programming, web development and esoteric technologies among which Emacs is by far my favorite. Recently I have also caught an interest in chess and competitive programming although I'm still in the newbie phase there.

This is my blog where I post about programming, technology and other topics that interest me.
