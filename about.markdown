I'm Olav or fossegrim as is my pseudonym online. I enjoy programming, web development and esoteric technologies among which Emacs is by far my favorite. Recently I've also caught an interest in chess and competitive programming although I'm still in the newbie phase there.

This is my blog where I post about programming, technology and other topics that interest me.
